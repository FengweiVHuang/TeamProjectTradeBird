# **Issues with Current Second-Hand Trading Platforms**

Second-hand trading is an integral part of student life at UBC, helping students save money and find essential items. However, current second-hand trading platforms present significant challenges, particularly for UBC students, due to their design and user base. These platforms fail to address the specific needs of a campus community, leading to inefficiencies, safety concerns, and a lack of trust among users.

## **Consequences**
The shortcomings of existing second-hand trading platforms have led to various negative outcomes for UBC students:
- **Safety Concerns:** Students feel unsafe due to unverified user identities and the inability to ensure trustworthiness during transactions.  
- **Time Wasted:** Students often spend excessive time sifting through irrelevant listings, reducing the overall convenience of using these platforms.  
- **Financial Burden:** Higher logistics and transaction costs discourage students from completing purchases or sales.  
- **Community Disconnect:** The lack of a campus-focused trading environment erodes trust and limits social connections between buyers and sellers.

## **Causes**
Several factors contribute to these issues:
1. **Broad User Base:** Public platforms cater to a wide range of users, making it difficult to verify identities or limit participation to UBC students.  
2. **Inefficient Product Matching:** Non-student-related items are too numerous, making it difficult for students to find the items they need.  
3. **Geographical Challenges:** Sellers and buyers located off-campus often live far apart, making in-person transactions inconvenient and driving up shipping costs.  
4. **Disconnected Community:** Platforms fail to create a sense of trust or belonging within the campus trading community, leading to weaker interactions among users.

## **Why Existing Solutions Fall Short**
While public second-hand trading platforms like Facebook Marketplace provide a space for transactions, they do not meet the specific needs of UBC students. These platforms:
- Lack identity verification, leaving students exposed to potential risks.  
- Non-student-related items are too numerous, making it difficult for students to find the items they need.  
- Offer no solutions to reduce logistical costs for students.  
- Fail to foster a localized, trustworthy trading community tailored to UBC's environment.

## **Conclusion**
These unresolved issues with current second-hand trading platforms highlight the need for a more tailored solution that addresses the unique challenges faced by UBC students.
